## ✅ Deployment Guide Analysis
Based on provided deployment guide, need to implement:
1. **Backend Structure** (python-backend/)
   - [ ] api.py with CLIENT_DATA imports & env variables
   - [ ] client_config.py with placeholder data
   - [ ] requirements.txt with fastapi, uvicorn, openai
   
2. **Frontend Structure** (ui/)
   - [ ] /api/chat endpoint with Authorization header
   - [ ] .env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERNAL_API_KEY
   - [ ] Local development setup

3. **Deployment Process**
   - [ ] GitHub repository (✅ already exists)
   - [ ] Vercel project configuration
   - [ ] Environment variables setup
   - [ ] Client onboarding workflow

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. **COMPLETED:** ✅ Implemented new simple api.py 
2. **COMPLETED:** ✅ Created client_config.py template
3. **COMPLETED:** ✅ Updated frontend components with branding
4. **COMPLETED:** ✅ Fixed backend import issue
5. **COMPLETED:** ✅ Created Next.js API proxy routes (/api/health, /api/chat)
6. **COMPLETED:** ✅ MEMORY UPGRADE - Backend accepts full message history
7. **COMPLETED:** ✅ MEMORY UPGRADE - Frontend sends full conversation context
8. **COMPLETED:** ✅ Added professional lead capture follow-through rule
9. **COMPLETED:** ✅ PRODUCTION FIX - Forceful prompt to prevent re-engagement
10. **COMPLETED:** ✅ PRODUCTION FIX - Lead email delivery system
11. **COMPLETED:** ✅ PRODUCTION FIX - Lead detection with name/phone extraction
12. **CURRENT:** 🔧 Install email dependencies and test complete system

## 📝 Strategic Decision Made
**OPTION B SELECTED:** Simple, client-configurable system
**Rationale:** "Selling Honda Civics, not Formula 1 engines"
**Target:** 2-hour client onboarding with reliable, easy-to-maintain solution

## 📋 Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **BLOCKED:** Structure alignment decision
- [ ] Local testing working
- [ ] GitHub repository ready
- [ ] Vercel environment variables configured
- [ ] Client onboarding process documented
- [ ] Template ready for replication

## 🎯 Success Criteria
Create a repeatable "machine" that can:
1. Take master template → new client repository 
2. Update client_config.py with business data
3. Deploy to unique Vercel URL
4. Provide embeddable widget code

## 📝 Notes
- Avoid desktop directory listing (causes crashes)
- Edit original files only (no new versions)
- Focus on easiest route to completion
- Update this progress file at start of each session
