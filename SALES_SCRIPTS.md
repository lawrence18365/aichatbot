# SALES SCRIPTS FOR LEADAISY

## EMAIL COLD OUTREACH SCRIPT

**Subject: Stop losing customers who visit your website after hours**

Hi [Business Owner Name],

I noticed [Business Name] has a website but no way for visitors to get help when you're closed.

Here's what's happening: Someone visits your site at 8pm on Sunday, they have questions about your services, but there's no one to help them. So they leave and call your competitor on Monday instead.

I built a simple AI chatbot that solves this problem:
- Talks to your website visitors 24/7
- Answers common questions about your services
- Captures their contact info when they're interested
- Emails you their details immediately

It takes 5 minutes to add to your website and costs $97/month.

Would you like to see a 2-minute demo of how it works?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]

P.S. I'm only working with 10 local businesses this month. If you're interested, let me know this week.

## PHONE SCRIPT (COLD CALLING)

### Opening
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I help local businesses like [Business Type] capture more leads from their websites. Do you have 30 seconds for me to explain how?"

### If they say YES:
"Great! Quick question - when someone visits your website at night or on weekends and has questions about your services, what happens?"

[Wait for response - usually "nothing" or "they have to wait"]

"Exactly. That's lost business. I created a simple AI chatbot that talks to your website visitors 24/7, answers their questions, and captures their contact info. When someone's interested, it emails you immediately."

"It costs $97 a month and I can have it live on your site in 24 hours. Would you like to see a quick demo?"

### If they say NO:
"No worries! Can I ask - do you currently have a way for website visitors to get help outside business hours?"

[If no] "That's pretty common. I help businesses capture those leads they're losing. If you ever want to see how it works, just give me a call at [phone]. Have a great day!"

### Demo Close:
"Perfect! I can show you exactly how it works on a quick screen share. Are you free for 10 minutes today or would tomorrow work better?"

## PRICING OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "That's too expensive"
"I understand. Let me ask - how much is one new customer worth to your business? Most of my clients say between $500-$2000. If this captures just one extra customer every two months, it pays for itself. Plus you're getting 24/7 coverage."

### "We already have a contact form"
"Contact forms are great, but here's the difference: When someone fills out a form at 2am, they're still shopping around on Monday. When they chat with your AI assistant, they get immediate answers and you get their info right away. Much higher conversion."

### "I need to think about it"
"Absolutely, it's a business decision. What specifically would you need to know to feel confident moving forward? I'm happy to answer any questions."

### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse"
"Of course! Would it help if I explained it to both of you on a quick call? I find it's easier when everyone can ask questions together."

## CLOSING QUESTIONS

- "Would you like to try this on your website for the next 30 days?"
- "Should we get this set up for you this week?"
- "Do you want me to have this live on your site by Friday?"
- "Would you prefer to start with the 14-day trial or jump right in?"

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES

### Day 1 (If no response to initial email):
**Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]**

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my email about capturing more leads from your website.

Quick question: On average, how many potential customers visit your website each week?

Even if it's 10-20 people, having an AI assistant available 24/7 could easily turn 2-3 of those into actual leads.

Worth a 5-minute conversation?

### Day 7:
**Subject: Last check-in about your website leads**

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short - I know you're busy running [Business Name].

I'm finishing up work with local businesses this month. If you'd like to see how the AI chatbot works before I move to the next city, just reply "DEMO" and I'll send you a quick video.

If not, no worries at all.

### Day 14 (Final follow-up):
**Subject: Moving on from [City Name]**

Hi [Name],

This is my last email - I'm wrapping up my work with [City] businesses and moving to the next market.

If you ever want to add 24/7 lead capture to your website, you can always reach me at [email] or [phone].

Thanks for your time!
