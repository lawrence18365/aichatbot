## üìû SALES SCRIPTS (COPY & PASTE)

### Cold Email:
```
Subject: Stop losing customers who visit your website after hours

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business] has a website but no way for visitors to get help when you're closed.

Here's what's happening: Someone visits your site at 8pm on Sunday, they have questions, but there's no one to help them. So they leave and call your competitor Monday instead.

I built a simple AI chatbot that solves this:
- Talks to visitors 24/7
- Captures their contact info  
- Emails you immediately

$97/month, 5 minutes to install.

Want to see a 2-minute demo?

[Your name]
```

### Phone Script:
```
"Hi [Name], I help local businesses capture more leads from their websites. When someone visits your site at night or weekends and has questions, what happens?"

[They say "nothing"]

"Exactly. That's lost business. I created an AI chatbot that talks to visitors 24/7 and emails you when they're interested. $97/month, live in 24 hours. Want to see how it works?"
```

### üéØ Focus Areas:

3. **OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY** - Streamline manual processes
4. **TECHNICAL SCALING** - Rebuild architecture with revenue

## üö® FINAL REALITY CHECK

### You Are Ready To Sell Because:
‚úÖ The chatbot works and captures leads  
‚úÖ Email delivery system is functional  
‚úÖ Website looks professional and converts  
‚úÖ Pricing is market-tested ($97/month)  
‚úÖ Installation process is documented  
‚úÖ Customer support process exists  

### You're NOT Ready For Scale Because:
‚ùå Manual deployment per customer  
‚ùå No centralized customer management  
‚ùå No automated billing/provisioning  
‚ùå No usage analytics or monitoring  

**BUT THAT'S OKAY!** 

Most successful SaaS companies started with manual operations. The goal is to get to $5K-$10K MRR manually, then use that revenue to build proper scaling infrastructure.
